= Introduction

During the workshop we implement application for management of orders.

Orders are managed by restaurant employees: chief, cook, barkeeper and waiter. Each of them can have different user rights.

Order is created per customer (owner) and contains collection of order positions (items) which are specified by name and price.
Each order has a status defining, what's happening with the order, f.e. NEW, PREPARING, PAID.
