= Introduction

During the workshop we will implement a multi-layered server application for management of the TODO tasks.

The users of this application should be able to create their task lists, add end edit the tasks, find the tasks based on name, completeness and/or deadline.

We are going to start with defining the data model and implementing data access layer. Happy Coding!
